                    A line of broken, stitched, weird, and scary plush 
                    toys from a design team led by American McGee and 
                    guided by our audience via Crowd Design.

                    Love hurts. Sometimes so much that it requires stitches 
                    and patches. But if we didn't risk it all we would not 
                    feel at all. So dare to love, to cuddle, and to 
                    sometimes lose it all.

                    Do Bears Love in the Woods?
                    Your old teddy bear might be tattered 
                    and torn from years of snuggling, but some of 
                    us are just made that way, and that's ok 
                    because we need love too! This bear has seen 
                    a whole lot of love, direct from us to you.
                    And what bear is complete without a hive full 
                    of bees that they definitely shouldn't be messing with...

                    A little scorpion attached magnetically to your back 
                    seems cute enough... until he stings the crap out of you 
                    halfway across the river and you both die a terrible 
                    death of drowning. You also get to suffer scorpion sting 
                    pain, so there's that. "I couldn't help it," says the scorpion. 
                    "It's my nature."
