                    Raiden (雷電?), real name Jack, also known
                    as Jack the Ripper, White Devil, and Snake, 
                    was a Liberian-American mercenary and former 
                    special forces soldier. Previously a child 
                    soldier under Solidus Snake, Raiden was later 
                    selected by the Patriots to test the S3 Plan at 
                    the Big Shell, as a new recruit to the reformed 
                    FOXHOUND unit. He later worked alongside the Paradise 
                    Lost Army in their anti-Patriot activities, but was 
                    captured and forced to undergo heavy cybernetic 
                    experimentation. After successfully escaping, 
                    Raiden went on to assist Solid Snake during the 
                    Guns of the Patriots Incident.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By 2018, Raiden had become a member of Maverick 
                    Security Consulting, Inc., doing multiple tasks 
                    while raising money for his family. However, 
                    during an escort mission in Africa they were 
                    attacked by Desperado Enforcement LLC., who 
                    killed Raiden's protectee, N'mani, and left Raiden 
                    for dead. Fortunately, he was saved by the scientist 
                    Wilhelm Voigt and worked with Maverick to fight Desperado. 
                    Raiden's vengeful obsession with Desperado became personal 
                    when he discovered during a mission in Mexico that Desperado 
                    and World Marshal Inc. had kidnapped several children, 
                    surgically removed their brains to place into cybernetic bodies, 
                    and were planning to subject them to VR training modeled after 
                    his own. Raiden then resigned from Maverick to pursue and 
                    retrieve the children's brain cases from World Marshal in Colorado.

                <h3>Names</h3>
                <p>
                    The word "Raiden" (雷電?) literally means 
                    "thunder and lightning" or "thunder god" in 
                    Japanese. He shares this codename with the 
                    Mitsubishi J2M Raiden, an Imperial Japanese 
                    WWII fighter aircraft, which the Allied forces 
                    codenamed "Jack." The Patriots had named him 
                    after the plane[24] and later informed Raiden 
                    that, like his namesake, he was nothing more 
                    than a weapon, a tool to be discarded once 
                    its usefulness has been outlived. 
                    This codename stayed with him after the 
                    Manhattan incident until the Patriots' fall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of Raiden's nicknames was White Devil. 
                    The nickname's use in this case was a reference 
                    to Caucasians (Raiden's ethnicity) being 
                    unusual in Liberia at the time of the 
                    Liberian Civil War.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another nickname of his was 
                    "Jack the Ripper," a pseudonym for 
                    an unidentified serial killer in 1888 who 
                    was active in the largely impoverished 
                    districts in and around Whitechapel, 
                    London. In this case, it was a reference 
                    to his skill and cruelty with a blade, 
                    a trait that was ingrained into him by Solidus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While operating as a private security consultant 
                    in Africa, Raiden worked with prime minister 
                    N'mani, who jokingly addressed him as "Mr. 
                    Lightning Bolt," in reference to his original 
                    code name.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During his battle with Stephen Armstrong, 
                    the senator called Raiden "Saucy Jack," 
                    which was the pen-name supposedly used by 
                    the original Jack the Ripper to London police 
                    at Scotland Yard after committing his second 
                    murder and onward.

                <h3>Unconfirmed history</h3>
                <p>
                    During his childhood in Liberia, Jack, 
                    on his tenth birthday, was ordered by 
                    Solidus Snake to decapitate ten captured 
                    Liberian terrorists responsible for killing 
                    Americans (each one representing a year in 
                    his life at the time) as the latter's 
                    "birthday present" for the former.[33]
                </p>
                <p>
                    At some point between his meeting with 
                    Rose and his participation in the Big Shell 
                    Incident, Rose had informed Raiden that he 
                    physically resembled the British singer/actor 
                    David Bowie from the latter's youth due to his 
                    androgynous features.[34]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Around the time Emma Emmerich's worm 
                    cluster was starting to affect GW, after 
                    the Colonel insinuated that Rosemary had 
                    cheated on Raiden with another man the 
                    Saturday before the mission, Raiden privately 
                    angrily denied it to be the case, but then 
                    started to doubt whether he knew her as well 
                    as he did.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Raiden's surgery following the events of 
                    Liquid Ocelot's Insurrection, where he was 
                    reunited with Rose and first met Little John, 
                    took place in a hospital in Maryland.[35]
