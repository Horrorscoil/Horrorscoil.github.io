                    This article is about the relaunched game, 
                    also known as A Realm Reborn. For the 
                    defunct original release, see Final Fantasy

                    Final Fantasy XIV[c] is a massively multiplayer 
                    online role-playing game(MMORPG) developed and 
                    published by Square Enix. Directed and produced 
                    by Naoki Yoshida and released worldwide 
                    for PlayStation 3 and Windows in August 2013, 
                    it replaced the failed 2010 version, with 
                    subsequent support for PlayStation 4, macOS, 
                    PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. Final Fantasy XIV 
                    is set in the fantasy region of Eorzea, 
                    five years after the devastating Seventh Umbral 
                    Calamity which ended the original version. 
                    In the Calamity, the elder primal Bahamut 
                    escaped from his prison, an ancient space 
                    station called Dalamud, unleashing an apocalypse 
                    across Eorzea. Through temporal magic, the player 
                    character of the original version escaped, 
                    reappearing at the start of A Realm Reborn. 
                    As Eorzea cements its recovery, the player must 
                    fend off a reignited invasion from the Garlean Empire.

                <p>
                    The original Final Fantasy XIV was a 
                    commercial and critical failure. 
                    Then-Square Enix President Yoichi 
                    Wada announced that a new team, 
                    led by Yoshida, would assume control 
                    and address the game's flaws. The new 
                    team both continued to develop and improve 
                    the original version, and secretly worked on 
                    a completely new replacement. This new game, 
                    codenamed "Version 2.0", used a new engine, 
                    improved server infrastructure, and revamped 
                    gameplay, interface, and story. The original 
                    version shut down in November 2012, followed 
                    by an alpha test for Version 2.0.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The relaunched game released to largely 
                    positive reception; critics praised its 
                    solid mechanics and progression, and 
                    commended Yoshida for an unexpected recovery. 
                    After a poor 2013 fiscal year, Square Enix 
                    attributed the 2014 return to profitability 
                    partly to the game's strong sales and 
                    subscriber base. By October 2021, it had 
                    gained over 24 million registered players, 
                    and become the most profitable Final Fantasy 
                    game to date.[1] Final Fantasy XIV has 
                    received regular updates since release, 
                    including five major expansion packs: 
                    Heavensward(2015), Stormblood (2017), 
                    Shadowbringers (2019), Endwalker (2021), 
                    and Dawntrail (2024).

                <h3 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h3>
                <p>
                    Final Fantasy XIV is an MMORPG, 
                    featuring a persistent world where 
                    players can interact with each other 
                    and the environment. Players create 
                    and customize their characters for 
                    use in the game, including name, race, 
                    gender, facial features, and starting 
                    class. Unlike in the original release, 
                    players may only choose to be a Disciple 
                    of War or Magic as a starting class—Disciples 
                    of the Hand and Land are initially unavailable.
                    [2] Players must also select a game server for 
                    each character. While all supported languages 
                    are available on every server, data centers 
                    are located in specific regions (i.e., North 
                    America, Europe, Japan, and Oceania) to 
                    reduce latency between client and server, 
                    and players are advised to choose a server in 
                    their region.[3] Regardless of server or 
                    language, players can use a large library of 
                    automatically translated game terms and general 
                    phrases, allowing players who speak different 
                    languages to communicate.[4]
                </p>

                <h4 id="interface">Interface</h4>
                <p>
                    PC and home console versions use a unified 
                    user interface (UI) and control scheme 
                    allowing for any combination of keyboard, 
                    mouse, and game controller. On PC, the game 
                    defaults to drag and drop menus, whereas on 
                    the console versions, the default interface 
                    resembles the PlayStation 3's XrossMediaBar.[5] 
                    This bar is used to access menus, maps, logs, 
                    and configuration options. The head-up display 
                    for both versions includes a message log, party 
                    status menu, mini-map, and action bar. The size 
                    and location of all UI elements may be customized.[6]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Actions and battle commands differ between PC 
                    and console versions. The PC versions support both 
                    point and click and keyboard input for commands or 
                    macros. Macro commands are customizable sequences of 
                    actions that allow players to execute desired abilities 
                    at a specific time. The home console versions instead 
                    map the action bar and macros to the "Cross Hotbar"—sets 
                    of four icons arranged in a cross shape. These are the 
                    grouped and accessed through a combination of the 
                    shoulder buttons and the directional pad or the face 
                    buttons. Using each shoulder button to cycle through 
                    the cross sets, players have quick access to commands. 
                    This interface is also available to PC players who use 
                    controllers.[5]
                </p>

                <h4 id="character-p">Character progression</h4>
                <p>
                    Players improve their characters by 
                    gaining experience points (EXP) and 
                    acquiring stronger equipment. After 
                    gaining enough XP, the character will 
                    "level up", improving their statistics, 
                    enhancing the character's performance, 
                    and often learning new actions. 
                    Primary sources of experience points 
                    in Final Fantasy XIV include completing 
                    quests, exploring instanced dungeons, 
                    participating in Full Active Time Events 
                    (FATEs), and slaying monsters in the world.
                    [7] Quests, including the "main scenario" 
                    questline, are generally short, specific 
                    tasks given to the player by non-player 
                    characters which reward items and EXP. 
                    Completing main scenario quests progresses 
                    the overarching plot of the game. Some quests 
                    are repeatable, either "daily" quests 
                    repeatable each day, or "Levequests", which 
                    consume "leve allowances" that the player 
                    slowly accrues over time. Dungeons often 
                    require multiple players to form a party to 
                    enter, but the Duty Support system enables 
                    the player to play certain dungeons alone, 
                    supported by computer-controlled party 
                    members. Some dungeons are for lower-leveled 
                    players to gain EXP quickly while others are 
                    for experienced players to collect rare items, 
                    equipment, and currency.[8] The Duty Roulette 
                    system randomly assigns the player to an accessible 
                    dungeon, and once per day, awards additional bonus 
                    EXP scaled to character level on completion.[9] 
                    FATEs permit large groups of players, whether 
                    or not they are in a party, to participate in a 
                    shared task in the world. These location-specific 
                    events include battles with notorious monsters, 
                    defending locations, escorting non-player characters, 
                    culling wildlife, and assaulting enemy fortresses, 
                    among other types.[8] Finally, each enemy the player 
                    kills provides EXP, with further EXP available from 
                    the Hunting Log, for killing a fixed amount of specific 
                    creatures. At maximum level, character progression 
                    focuses entirely on acquiring stronger equipment, 
                    raising the character's "item level". This equipment 
                    can be gained through a variety of sources including 
                    endgame dungeons, crafting, raids, primal battles, and 
                    elite mark hunts.[10]
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to these player versus environment 
                    (PvE) challenges, various forms of player versus 
                    player (PvP) combat exist in Final Fantasy XIV. 
                    The Feast was an arena featuring structured 
                    four-versus-four battles where a player could 
                    register with up to three teammates to challenge 
                    another four-person team. This mode was removed in 
                    patch 6.1, when it was replaced with Crystalline 
                    Conflict,[11] which consists of two teams of five 
                    competing to seize control of and push a crystal 
                    which starts at the middle of the arena to each 
                    team's goal point. The second type, Frontlines, 
                    is a large battleground in which players form 
                    teams of up to 24 members. Teams are delineated 
                    by players' allegiance to one of three Grand 
                    Companies and the team which reaches the target 
                    number of points first wins the match. Multiple 
                    modes are available, each with differing locations 
                    and rulesets. Within the game, Frontlines is presented 
                    as an organized set of military exercises between 
                    the three nations with the ulterior goal of jockeying 
                    for dominance of regions rich in magical artifacts.[12]
                     The third type, Rival Wings, is a battle arena mode 
                    where players manipulate minion waves and pilot mechs 
                    to destroy enemy objectives.

                    § Synopsis
                </p>
                <p>
                    Final Fantasy XIV is set on Hydaelyn, a 
                    fictional world of diverse environments 
                    across multiple continents, focused on 
                    the region of Eorzea.[22] Eorzea features 
                    four prominent city-states: Gridania, in 
                    the heavily-forested Black Shroud; Ul'dah, 
                    a trade-centric sultanate in arid Thanalan; 
                    Limsa Lominsa, a thalassocracy on the island 
                    of Vylbrand; and Ishgard, an isolationist 
                    theocracy in snowy, mountainous Coerthas. 
                    A land bridge links Eorzea to two other 
                    continents to the east, which have largely 
                    been conquered by the Garlean Empire. Other 
                    societies include indigenous tribes, such as 
                    Sylphs and Kobolds; Sharlayan, a scholarly city; 
                    and Ala Mhigo in eastern Eorzea, annexed twenty 
                    years prior by the Garlean Empire.[23] Facing 
                    Garlean invasion, Ishgard withdrew from the 
                    Eorzean Alliance, leaving it defunct. The 
                    once-vibrant Mor Dhona region was devastated 
                    during the previous Garlean campaign.[24]
                </p>

                <h4 id="character">Characters</h4>
                <p>
                    The player character is an Eorzean 
                    adventurer during the Seventh Umbral 
                    Era who joins one of the Grand Companies: 
                    Gridania's Order of the Twin Adder, under 
                    Elder Seedseer Kan-E-Senna; Ul'dah's Immortal 
                    Flames, under Flame General Raubahn Aldynn; 
                    and the Maelstrom of Limsa Lominsa under 
                    Admiral Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn.[31] Their 
                    allies include Minfilia and her Scions 
                    of the Seventh Dawn, a rebuilt Sixth 
                    Astral Era organization uniting 
                    Louisoix's Circle of Knowing and 
                    Minfilia's Path of the Twelve.[32] 
                    Members include Thancred, Yda, Papalymo, 
                    Urianger, and Y'shtola. Y'shtola often 
                    represents Final Fantasy XIV in crossovers 
                    like Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: Curtain 
                    Call and Dissidia Final Fantasy NT.[33][34] 
                    Louisoix's twin grandchildren, Alphinaud 
                    and Alisaie, follow his example to aid Eorzea. 
                    Finally, Cid Garlond heads Garlond Ironworks,

                    weapons, and infrastructure to the Alliance.[32]

                    Garlean antagonists include Legatus Gaius van 
                    Baelsar of the XIVth Imperial Legion and his 
                    lieutenants, Livia sas Junius, Rhitahtyn sas 
                    Arvina, and Nero tol Scaeva. The tribes also 
                    threaten the uneasy peace by summoning primals, 
                    aetherial deities which drain the land's 
                    life-sustaining energy.[35] Both are manipulated 
                    by the Ascians, hooded immortals hellbent on 
                    awakening their dark god Zodiark, imperiling 
                    all of Hydaelyn.[36]
